# spotmicro
Arduino code repo for my build of the Spot Micro project, more specifically Michael's Kubina version!

You can find it [here](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32) :)

Otherwise, have fun reading over my code! Can't say it's perfect, but it's for a school project and if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to raise an issue or send a pull request :D
